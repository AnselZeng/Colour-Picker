# Colour-Picker

> https://anselzeng.github.io/Colour-Picker/

> A simple colour picker program where the user gets to choose a colour and the program displays the HEX colour code.
- This is just a small prototype of me playing around with CSS and JavaScript.
- I am currently working on adding an option to type in an initial colour (through text, HEX, or RGB) and the program will display different shades of the given colour.
